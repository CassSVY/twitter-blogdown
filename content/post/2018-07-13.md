# blogdown

> **Corey Pembleton** (@coreypembleton; 3/1): My fledgling #blogdown site is up, with the first post in #evaluation and how to use #datascience methods in #rstats for cleaning string-heavy data.

> **Ken Butler** (@KenButler12; 1/0): @ek_kearney It looks very sharp. I never quite managed to get netlify to work with my blogdown site - it was  on Github pages for a while, but I spent a ludicrously small amount on a custom domain.

> **tj mahr üçïüçç** (@tjmahr; 4/0): @xieyihui hey I read the blog post with me complaining about bookdown! I do think it‚Äôs amazing. I was just panicking and venting bc my dissertation is due in 10 days and bookdown was surprising me in not a good way. üòÖ I do love sending people to a URL for latest drafts  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1017415868517683200)

Case in point: the Python version of bookdown looks to be on the way: https://t.co/a3iAUNuCQZ  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1017256961253896193)
