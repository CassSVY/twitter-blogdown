# blogdown

> **Mark Greenaway** (@certifiedwaif; 11/0): I just got out of @statsgen's blogdown seminar. I went in knowing literally nothing about blogdown, or hugo (I thought Hugo was a person) and came out knowing quite a bit more than that. I even wrote some blog posts. Great work Emi!

> **Nathan Brouwer** (@lobrowR; 8/7): for academic sites, if you are familiar with #rstats &amp; rmarkdown (knowning a bit about github helps) you can leverage that.  Probably the neatest is using the blogdown R package.  See the fabulous tweetorial w/ click by click instruction by @dsquintana https://t.co/EgSgfFYkfU

> **kasiek** (@KKulma; 5/1): I've finally written an #rstats post for my Jekyll blog after a loooong break. 
With-LOTS-of-#Leaflet-maps.
Then tried to publish it. And tried. And tried. 
And now I think it will be easier to finally set up a #blogdown blog that I promised myself a long time ago üò´/ü•∞  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1029869642523836417)

BTW there is a problem with the map code in that post, but my blogdown config is broken and I haven't fixed it yet  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1029701844556234752)

> **Susannah Cowtan** (@SuusJC; 0/1): Trying out blogdown. Anyone know how to get rid of the (#chunkname)  in front of my plot caption?  I tried fig.lp = "" and  removing underscores in the chunk names (which had no effect on ubuntu)  as suggested in StackExchange.  https://t.co/x96Xi8QQlP ‚Ä¶ #rLadies #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1029683774970310656)

# bookdown

> **Nathan Brouwer** (@lobrowR; 1/0): another option that could work for a personal site: using rmarkdown's basic website capabilities &amp; github pages.  I think I just followed the instruction in the rmarkdown bk https://t.co/h2L6x5d9l6 &amp; sketched out a site for one of my courses in an evening

> **Nathan Brouwer** (@lobrowR; 1/0): I'm pretty good at rmarkdown but otherwise ignorant of bookdown, Hugo, and Netlify and converted the "Academic" theme to my needs to an evening
my proto site looks like tis

# knitr

> **Peter Ellis** (@ellis2013nz; 1/0): @hannah_recht Stack Overflow has a fair chunk of helpful questions on similar ptobd. From memory, knitr and some other relevant packages at one point explicitly asked for Qs to be put on SO.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1029728877466144768)

# xaringan
