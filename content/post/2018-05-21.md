> **Ross Gayler** (@ross_gayler; 0/0): I have a new blogdown-based personal website (https://t.co/c3mPD1rXt4) and a blog post describing how I built it (https://t.co/xMSLZ8ixBz). Thanks to @dataandme, @yihu, @georgecushen, and #RStudio #blogdown #hugoacademic communities for the help.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/998343546200457218)

> **Dale Maschette** (@Dale_Masch; 0/0): @dataandme I’m also cursed with having to read books I start, I date a book-not-finisher and she upsets my soul. Also you should read the book and then write a blog on using blogdown and github because from my experience so far it is worthy of fight scene style writing  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/998328093566631936)
