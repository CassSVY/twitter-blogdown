> **Dorris A. Scott** (@Dorris_Scott; 9/3): Day 2 of #100DaysOfCode: Deploying a Blogdown Site with Netlify...the struggle is real. I'm going to have to walk away from this for now and deal with it tomorrow. https://t.co/iLRXUTCcWP  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/981731528555356162)

> **Lorenzo Busetto** (@lbusetto74; 3/2): Well, I definitely did not expect so much interest for a package with a grand-total of two functions ;-)... sometimes the simplest ideas.... FYI: I just pushed an update on GitHub to solve a bug preventig knitting the table  to Word/PDF with kable. @rstudio #rstats #blogdown  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/981877583934644224)

> **James Eddy** (@jamesaeddy; 3/1): Thanks as well to our @ISBUSA collaborators: @gibbsdavidl who built our landing page (with blogdown &amp; Hugo) and contributed code and analysis, plus Vesteinn Thorsson for his direction and leadership. This has been an incredible team to work with. (n/n)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/981997643386601473)

> **Hao Ye** (@Hao_and_Y; 1/0): @WrightingApril @rhiacoon Same. Rmarkdown could be nice if you want to integrate with a blogdown website, I imagine.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/981746993847590912)

> **Ben Marwick** (@benmarwick; 4/0): @juliesquid @CSSCR Thanks! It's really great to have @xieyihui's bookdown &amp; @old_man_chester's thesisdown to build on here. I'm a bit slow with R Markdown for slides though. Xaringan is a big step forward, but still feel like I have to fiddle with CSS way too much to make things fit &amp; legible  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/981971726836711424)

> **Aetiologic** (@aetiologic; 0/0): Any tricks to reduce PDF filesize in #bookdown output? Chapter is ggplot2+lots of alpha, so very image rich. But 90MB for 40 pages is too big. Prints fine, but can't email, etc.

Being forced to write slides without a vertical scrollbar makes me question most of past Martin's choices.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/981901149736497152)
