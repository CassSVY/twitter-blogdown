> **Houston Haynes** (@whiskersedge; 1/0): @nthonyChu @paulhuff @docsmsft I'm creating an R #blogdown based site and pushing via @code but am researching @Netlify and @travisci via Hugo documentation. Would be great to see other patterns.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1015291374273380352)

> **Rich Majerus** (@richmajerus; 1/0): @apreshill Still works great! I was sputtering on getting a blogdown site up when I came across this today and I'm up and running within a couple of hours. Looking forward to v2.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1015248385501286401)

> **Dr. Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 0/0): @richmajerus So glad it is still helpful! Need to update based on teaching with #blogdown this past quarter 😉  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1015245192620732418)

> **RONAK SHAH** (@shahronak47; 0/0): @xieyihui @dataandme It looks like "shortcodes" is in 0.7 version which is not on CRAN yet, nor devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown') upgrades me to 0.7. Anyway, I got an idea how it works from the source code. I'll post it on SO next time. Thank you for your patience. :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1015093782532931585)

> **nextgenseek** (@nextgenseek; 1/0): @drob @condwanaland taught a couple of  @swcarpentry workshops with markdown with knitr pretty early and it was way more successful than I feared.  People loved the ability to write notes in markdown. R vs Rmd confusion was there but it was not bad.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1015219489800097792)
