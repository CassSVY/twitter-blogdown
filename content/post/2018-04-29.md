> **Dr Jenny Richmond** (@JenRichmondPhD; 2/1): Newsflash: @djnavarro is blogging about a new (to her) R package every day! She is funny and honest and super-informative. So far she's covered blogdown, emo, and h2o. Check.. it.. out.... hmmm how does she get her functions to appear in red text in a pink box I wonder...#rstats https://t.co/gkZfPYMHQt  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/990364376220581888)
