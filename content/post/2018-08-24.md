> **Ben R. Fitzpatrick** (@benrfitzpatrick; 1/2): upcoming talk on #rstats #blogdown @ZurichRUsers should be very interesting for researchers looking to set up a homepage &amp;/ blog to showcase their research. Anyone else from @WSL_research coming?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1032550895421140992)

The second -- which is what I've always used -- doesn't. Same image is stored in /static/img https://t.co/1nwrcbSn0y  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1032659346772115456)

> **üåüem.üåü** (@anyembutme; 0/0): SO. As part of #SoDS18 I said I would make a blog. üéâüéâüéâ I did the thing using #blogdown (and boy was that a learning curve)! When I start my MSc in a few weeks, this will be a great place to document all my learning!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1032755800152911873)
