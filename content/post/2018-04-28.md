# knitr

> **Ruben C. Arslan** (@rubenarslan; 0/0): @mjbsp With knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = T) you can get it to finish in spite of the error. The new message tells me there's something odd about that variable. If you could paste dput(yourdata$thatvariable)  into a GitHub issue that would help me.
