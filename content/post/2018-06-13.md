> **Christopher Prener** (@chrisprener; 0/0): Among the things I love about #bookdown syllabi - increases accessibility for students who benefit from that (flexible font size / color schemes), easy to update, hyperlinks can integrate more deeply with LMS, responsive design for mobile devices...

BTW, slides are at https://t.co/cWHba4ricB as I mentioned in the end of the talk. Once again, thanks for having me give the talk!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1006552189114966023)

> **Helicity Boson** (@HelicityBoson; 1/0): The way Rmarkdown/knitr deals with working directories in #rstats is absolutely infuriating  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1006454752232853504)

> **Radoslaw Panczak** (@RPanczak; 0/0): After 6mo of intensive switch to #Rstats (with @rstudio, #knitr, #tidyverse &amp; all other wonders) I went back to to check @Stata dynamic documents in #markdown. Boy was I surprised. I thought there was a gap. Now i think there is an abyss!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1006718425924685824)

> **Helicity Boson** (@HelicityBoson; 0/0): @rstudio I think it would be nice if you included this information somewhere on your rmarkdown documentation page: https://t.co/MYsopAhl6k  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1006461260341415936)
