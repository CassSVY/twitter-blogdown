> **Ilja** (@fubits; 2/2): Apparently, there's quite a bunch of other people having as much *fun* with blogdown (&amp; #Rstats). This post (and the #100daysofcode blog series in general) is a gem. Cheers, @djnavarro! #blogdown https://t.co/gszf2Dxsw6  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1007741824990105606)

Then I realized I missed it‚Äîis it a knitr/Rmarkdown tibble output option? Does anyone know? #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1007785017416617984)

> **Richard Iannone** (@riannone; 0/0): @mitchoharawild @garthtarr @IsabellaGhement @rstudio For this package, the trick was to use SVG, which works equally well in headers as it does in regular text. We used a `knitr::knit_print()` method to make sure the SVG functioned properly in both Rmd and in Shiny.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1007467172367659013)
