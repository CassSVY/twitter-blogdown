> **Davis Vaughan** (@dvaughan32; 5/0): @CMastication @rstudio This wasn't a dissertation but I did my final project in bookdown and rendered as HTML and PDF successfully. I felt proud of it. Images, equations, tables, etc. https://t.co/iGaMZL5TEY  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1036222898061627393)

> **Greg Tucker-Kellogg** (@gtuckerkellogg; 0/0): @CMastication @rstudio For completeness, I don't understand why RMarkdown and bookdown chose to extend pandoc's markdown syntax. Maybe the extensions were offered to pandoc and weren't accepted; I don't know and don't want to presume.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1036414713314258945)

> **Shawn Graham** (@electricarchaeo; 0/0): bookdown question. the default latex template (default-1.17.0.2.tex) scrunches tables up into the middle of the page. How to alter to make it span across entire width?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1036284821104943105)

> **Raymond Tse** (@rtse999; 0/0): #rstats ezknitr is 2 years old now - have these changes been incorporated into the knitr package ?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1036104665908170752)
