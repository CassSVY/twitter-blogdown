> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 119/17): The blogdown book package just arrived at my door (this sounds similar to last year https://t.co/LTtcP80lYZ). Not sure why they sent the expensive hardback copies this time, but it feels good to have something solid in my hands at the end of a year. https://t.co/9f5poTQgFc  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/944262791506157568)

I'm using the preview deploy function and just dragging my public folder over for now. #blogdown #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/944343927896858625)

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 0/0): @_ColinFay That is totally fine to me (even if it is released to CRAN) and thanks for sharing it! All I intended to express was that if you use Jekyll in the blogdown framework, you'll get some features for free, e.g. the New Post addin, LiveReload, etc.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/944240505533149184)

> **Colin Fay** (@_ColinFay; 0/0): @xieyihui Actually no, I didn't know that. I haven't take the time to read the Blogdown book (this is just a matter of time), and plan on using the package soon, but didn't have the time for now.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/944104178506502147)
