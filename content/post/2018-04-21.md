# blogdown

> **Andrew Heiss** (@andrewheiss; 3/0): Upon further reflection, I think this might be an #rstats R Markdown bug (unless it's by design for some reason?). In blogdown/bookdown, each Rmd gets its own new env, but with Rmd websites it seems that envs are bleeding into each other. Issue opened. https://t.co/ssGEA43R5z  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/987163945554214913)

> **LIBD rstats club** (@LIBDrstats; 2/2): Memberâ€™s activities today: fixed blog typos, started a blog post about learning #rstats, made the corner() function + docs + unit test and pushed to jaffelab https://t.co/tDMoi4R6sr, explored #blogdown, spent time learning R, debugged our blog and an encoding issue. Fun times ^^  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/987478555939561473)

> **Andrew Heiss** (@andrewheiss; 0/0): @juliasilge Yeah, it's totally weird, and I've been using blogdown so much that I've just assumed Rmd websites do the same thing.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/987166960067657728)

> **Julia Silge** (@juliasilge; 0/0): @andrewheiss That sounds... weird/bad. I have more experience with blogdown/bookdown, and definitely everything gets knit separately in separate environments there.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/987164559529168896)

> **Andrew Heiss** (@andrewheiss; 0/0): @rmkubinec And actually, your blog comment makes me think that this might be a deeper issue with R Markdown. In my blogdown projects each Rmd file *does* get its own clean environment. But with smaller R Markdown-only sites, the Rmd files are doing this sharing thing.

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 7/0): @expersso @rstudio Very glad to hear that! This seems to be the first time I have seen theorem environments in bookdown actually used by someone!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/987334111122612224)

> **David Keyes** (@dgkeyes; 2/0): It was amazingly easy to use the bookdown package in #rstats to make this. Thanks to @xieyihui for his work to make it!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/987376993942388736)
