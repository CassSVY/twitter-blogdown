> **Ali Twelvetrees** (@dozenoaks; 4/0): I've spent the last week figuring out the RStudio/blogdown/GitHub/Hugo/Netlify thing as a “fun” side project. It has been slightly scary, but I think it’s finally coming together.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970696512677261313)

Thanks

> **Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 1/0): @pprabaka1 Try upgrading your R version and your blogdown to the dev version first. I know it is a pain but it looks like your version of R if over a year old. I used @bearloga's script to update my packages recently and it worked perfectly! https://t.co/fdWf3wXx02  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970829316710850560)

<!-- -->


> **Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 0/0): @pprabaka1 Lots of possibilities! I suggest posting on Stack Overflow with the blogdown tag, and include info about your R version and blogdown package version  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970819831351013376)

> **Irene Steves** (@i_steves; 1/1): Hey #rstats: is it possible to create two #bookdown's 📖📖 from a single repo? (in our case: we have a bunch of rmd's, some which we want in our "initial training book," some in our "reference guide," and some in both) @xieyihui  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970723356965158913)

> **かつどん** (@nozma; 1/0): bookdownのload_config()、_bookdown.ymlしか見ないからbookdown固有っぽいオプションはRmdのフロントマターに書いてもダメなんだな  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970785581050425346)

# knitr

> **Garrick Aden-Buie** (@grrrck; 6/5): TWIL (this weekend I learned) how to efficiently reuse Rmd chunks in #rstats package vignettes, README, blog posts, pkgdown articles and anywhere else Rmd is accepted! Thanks to @BrodieGaslam &amp; @carroll_jono and the #knitr child chunk options 🙏 https://t.co/SyhcaEZLT3  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970732868786892803)

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 2/0): @WinVectorLLC How about the last image on https://t.co/u4aAmeiwXX ? Basically rmarkdown = knitr + pandoc  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970741842848382978)

<!-- -->


> **WinVector LLC** (@WinVectorLLC; 1/0): @xieyihui The reason I ask is: we use knitr in Practical Data Science with R, and somebody from RStudio is asking why we don't use rmarkdown instead.  And I have no idea what that question even means at this point.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970698066524192768)

<!-- -->


> **WinVector LLC** (@WinVectorLLC; 0/0): @xieyihui Ah that helps, thanks.  I was probably confusing the 3 pkgs: markdown, rmarkdown, and knitr.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/970748560714039296)

<!-- -->


> **WinVector LLC** (@WinVectorLLC; 0/0): @xieyihui I still do not get it.  rmarkdown is not mentioned in the first bullet, and the second bullet would seem to imply rmarkdown unifies knitr and other options (which seems backwards from the declared package dependencies).
