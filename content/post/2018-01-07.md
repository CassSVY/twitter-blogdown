Using blogdown and @netlify together gives me the power to publish .Rmd blogs w/ @rstudio and the flexibility to publish .md blogs via iOS - awesome! #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949657754310008832)

Hope it helps!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949704024688914432)

The alternative is to use the `preserve_yaml` arg for retaining metadata and rending to .md (my preferred option)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949758374522089478)

> **Alex Spurrier** (@alspur; 1/0): Reading @xieyihui’s blogdown book and @jsonbecker’s https://t.co/kFKN4UVj0D source code was instrumental in helping me figure out how to make the move to Hugo - many thanks!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949658526481354752)

> **Anderson Neisse** (@a_neisse; 1/0): @kierisi Yes! Despite it not ending as I wanted because of some unsupported features by blogdown, I enjoyed writing the post. Also, the community has grown a lot, yes! I myself dove into the tidyverse only after joining the community, and it brought so much more than just the tidyverse!

# bookdown

> **b❆B Rudis** (@hrbrmstr; 10/0): For 2018 I also resolved to (finally!) wire up my web access logs to mongo via fluentd (why fluent+mongo? it's super quick to setup for weblog shunting). Can live-connect to it remotely w/@apachedrill via ssh tunnel to use sergeant &amp; ggplot2 to get live bookdown kindle-stats :-) https://t.co/X7Rsczsqv1  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949660488077643777)

> **b❆B Rudis** (@hrbrmstr; 0/0): @ApacheDrill it def was capturing all the component URLs vs pages. bookdown authors shld def host somewhere they get logs from so they can see what content folks visited the most (if you use google analytics you can drill down to this too) https://t.co/tZIgswmOrF  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949665975145828353)

> **Oliver Fisher, MD** (@OMaxFisher; 1/1): Best packages/workflows/scripts/loops for producing #rstats output for non-statisticians to read &amp; 4 making tables etc in medical papers? Re-writing .rmd and #knitr files is lengthy, repetitive and simply tedious. There‘s gotta be a better #r way? @rdpeng @bcaffo  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949789816945745920)

> **Jim Crozier** (@crozierrj; 0/0): @CMastication You can do your latex stuff (like toc) plus knit in lots of different kernels (python, r, scala, others) as chunks. Makes reports with stats and graphics easy. I also do tex stuff outside knitr and just call it in when needed. I'll put something on github if you're interested.
