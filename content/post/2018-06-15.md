> **Julia Pilowsky** (@hivemindatwork; 1/0): Thinking of migrating my Jekyll site to Hugo and #blogdown like all the cool kids are doing. What do academics think of the blogdown setup?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1007187896028356608)

> **Sébastien Rochette** (@StatnMap; 2/1): TIL @Bioconductor suggests a unified html &amp; pdf 📦vignette style based on #bookdown that is really nice. CRAN #rstats📦vignettes may be more attractive with this style ! Nice work of @andrzejkoles et al. https://t.co/pakyZkCNEs https://t.co/kHCNIhwPcV  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1007185781868384257)

You can download it as epub or pdf but I can't vouch for the formatting on those 😅  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1007390510321827840)

> **Dr. Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 1/0): @gringene_bio @RLadiesGlobal it doesn't set it per image (that is slide 30), resizing chunk-by-chunk. You can set it for all imaged by setting your global chunk options (as I showed on slide 31). See: https://t.co/YoWF2WmnSI  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1007088262660231169)
