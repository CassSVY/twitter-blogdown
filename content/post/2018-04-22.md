> **Danielle Navarro** (@djnavarro; 0/0): I am finding blogdown both awesome and frustrating. I can kind of get it to work as long as I'm following the instructions, but every time I go off script something breaks and I don't understand why. Learning new things is the *worst*

Listening to it as I head into the amazing @aberdeenunilib to write up more #rstats using #latex, #knitr and #rmarkdown. No option to use #jupyter sadly! https://t.co/hLG3O0198g  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/987610624191533056)
