# bookdown

> **DavidLawrenceMiller** (@millerdl; 2/0): @polesasunder @rmflight it is a reason to use bookdown, but a reason not to use it is that it breaks  ~30k words of a book I've half-written :-\  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/985131996262404100)

> **DavidLawrenceMiller** (@millerdl; 1/0): @polesasunder @rmflight 1. yes, this is probably my fault as I build my own bookdown so it doesn't play nice with newer stuff, 2. unfortunately I have left some things a little too later for a meeting with my editor on Monday :-\  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/985133039511572480)

You know it *is* Saturday, a time usually set aside for needless refactoring..  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/985132691610882048)

> **Robert M Flight ❓🤖❓** (@rmflight; 1/0): @millerdl I thought this was one of the reasons to use bookdown, even if it's not a "book"  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/985131068071260161)

> **N. Clement Weather** (@znmeb; 1/0): @jeremy_data LaTeX has index-builders; if you're using R Markdown / knitr / pandoc you can probably access one of them.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/984982044726870017)
