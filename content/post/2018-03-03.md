# knitr

> **DOCTOR Greg** (@StatsInTheWild; 8/0): I really want for @JustinVerlander to have made these himself and he had a knitr document explaining how he made them.  That's my dream. https://t.co/8lmfsLl6vp  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/969572281176424448)

> **Frank Harrell** (@f2harrell; 1/0): @fusaroli @rlmcelreath This is a wonderful resource for Bayesian modeling using R notebooks.  Suggestion: since code is nicely boxed off with R knitr, tell knitr to suppress ## in front of each line of code to make it easier to read and prettier.  For example see Hmisc::knitrSet  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/969575631955652608)

> **Doctorb Zhian N. Kamvar** (@ZKamvar; 3/0): So the @rstudio docker container switched to using TinyTeX some time ago and it caused one of my builds on Circle to fail. Luckily, the manual for TinyTeX was easy to read and I got my dependencies updated in no time! Thanks @xieyihui!
