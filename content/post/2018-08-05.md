> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 6/0): @cantabile @statsgen @stephenelane @apreshill &lt;video&gt; should be good, but you need a leading slash in src. See the first paragraph at https://t.co/ZcusdUSeGX and all gory details about URLs at https://t.co/id4TZC5R2r (this was my least favorite section to write in the book).

> **Julian Carrasquillo** (@JulianCarras; 1/0): Hey @drob - are you still sharing new blogs? I finally got mine going on #blogdown after some wrestling with .RMD support files üò¨. So far there's an AB Test analysis, but I'm working on getting a few more out there soon!. https://t.co/omXuod48Xl  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1025765404260495361)

> **Clayton Yochum** (@claytonyochum; 0/0): @dvaughan32 @thosjleeper @henrikbengtsson With enough work I think the first con could be handled by either bundling the go bin or having install helpers like blogdown does w/ hugo. No such solution for the second con...  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1025747937920462853)

There's a problem i'm facing that you talked about in issue https://t.co/OeYJpzsYvH regarding getting rid of hero widget. Can you please talk about how you did that?

But if you're looking for new content, I'd highly recommend @hadleywickham's "R for Data Science" https://t.co/2lB5gayoxq and @YaRrrBook's "A Pirate's Guide to R" https://t.co/ZYDmL8Qpjh  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1025590561338621952)
