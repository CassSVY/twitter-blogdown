> **Nick Zeng** (@zenggyu; 2/0): So I was playing with the #blogdown package and found an issue of the Hugo-academic theme, which led to some knowledge discovery about urls and a little trick for blog content management. #rstats https://t.co/FIMPBTlbLb  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/963915416694173696)

> **Glenn Williams** (@gwill88; 0/0): Top tip: When rendering an online book in #bookdown make sure your figure names don't have any spaces or the images won't be sent to your docs folder. This took me a lot longer to notice than it should have.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/963721016525709312)
