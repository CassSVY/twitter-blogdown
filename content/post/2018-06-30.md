> **Ming Tang** (@tangming2005; 7/1): Time to polish my newly deployed blogdown website. I can do it on flights without internet, because everything is within Rstudio! How cool is that? #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012705649262673921)

> **AndrÃ©s PÃ©rez-Figueroa** (@anpefi; 2/0): @tangming2005 @lesliemyint That's because the repo for the source (lmyint/personal_site) is different than the repo for the rendered HTML (lmyint/lmyint). I also use that approach, described in the Xu's book about blogdown, to allow automatization via Travis-CI  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012689348398080001)

> **Steven Ge** (@StevenXGe; 0/0): @ivivek87 @nuzzel Agreed. I stole a lot of code like this.  Earlier today,  I was looking into the  blogdown package to do my part.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012843873100533760)

# knitr

> **AuthorCarpentry** (@AuthorCarpentry; 4/0): Heading to @thecarpentries CarpentryConnectDavis this weekend? Two of us  â€” @doctornerdis +  @Repositorian â€” will see you there! Excited to share our work on lessons for Reproducible &amp; Dynamic Reporting w/ Markdown/Knitr/Pandoc pipeline incl data pulled from @ORCID_Org #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012737682747740160)

> **Michael Culshaw-Maurer** (@MCulshawMaurer; 2/0): Is there a way to preface the #rstats console output index, ie [1] by a #? knitr output is prefaced by ##, so all your results can be copy/pasted as comments, but can this be done in a regular R console, similar to making a custom prompt?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012835021969764353)

<!-- -->


> **Michael Culshaw-Maurer** (@MCulshawMaurer; 0/0): @vsbuffalo Close, but I want the output preceded by it, ie the index [1]. Basically the prompt option but for the output. You can do it in knitr with hooks, but not in base console as far as I can tell  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012849427990568960)

# xaringan

> **Emi Tanaka ðŸŒ¾** (@statsgen; 166/33): I think the true greatness of #xaringan #rstats package is not well known. If you are working on your slides, use xaringan::inf_mr() and then the file will be automatically knit after every save and goes to the slide your working on, NOT the 1st slide. Works with #rmarkdown too! https://t.co/ybSDgyiuUJ  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012664098616590336)

<!-- -->


> **Emi Tanaka ðŸŒ¾** (@statsgen; 2/0): @shazanfar I forgot about this until you mentioned something on slack! I actually didn't understand it at first but give it a try with inf_mr() while you are working on xaringan. It's kind of easier to show this in person what it is doing.
