Oh the joy of running your site on #blogdown https://t.co/ECWUekSc6e  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1005191380564697088)

> **Jason Ferrell** (@nullrejector; 1/0): @NickFoxstats It looks great!  I'm thinking about creating a blog with blogdown.  Is there anything in particular I should pay attention to?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1005116773874716674)

> **Dylan Wiwad** (@D_Wiwad; 0/0): @NickFoxstats @xieyihui Follow up naive question (sorry, I haven't perused the materials yet!) - is it possible/easy to integrate python into sites created with Blogdown? I have some python notebooks I'd like to be able to integrate and use...  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1005158065333624832)

# knitr

> **Thomas Leeper** (@thosjleeper; 0/0): @jzelner @digprof I very rarely write in rmarkdown if output is going to be PDF. I can't stand the mixed syntax. For articles, I always use latex or knitr rnw.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1005151263959511041)
