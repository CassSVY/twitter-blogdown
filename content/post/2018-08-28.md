# blogdown

> **kasiek** (@KKulma; 16/2): I couldn't be happier: just finished setting up my brand new #blogdown blog - it's good old #rtastic, but in much neater appearance. Learned loads in the process and probably halved the time it takes me now to publish an #rstats post. Check it out!  https://t.co/JgFXMqI1Z5  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1034169879778258945)

> **kasiek** (@KKulma; 15/4): My first 'proper' blog post on new #blogdown blog: exploring London crime using heatmaps in #rstats. You'll find here bits of web scraping, connecting to public API, writing functions and visualising complex data. Lots of fun for any data nerd ü§ì https://t.co/sA9npQO4IC https://t.co/lGGWE4S5ht  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1034171578148380673)

> **Alex Albright** (@AllbriteAllday; 5/0): Y'all. I finally did it... I REBUILT MY WEBSITE USING #blogdown! Soooo excited about the much improved blogging workflow! I then obviously had to blog about it. https://t.co/hgJPy1Zfwb #meta #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1034192351407816704)

I ended up just shopping around the themes that they recommended in the blogdown book. https://t.co/stX3CGJ6Pc I know the popular academic theme is LaTeX compatible. So is the one I picked -- XMin.

Is there a way I can fix this? I‚Äôm happy to tweet out my code #phdlife  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1034251386832080896)

> **Joshua Goldberg** (@GoldbergData; 0/0): @xieyihui I doubt this is a knitr error, but I attempted compiling an rmd with a large model object (~2 gigs), and I get this error. Curious if you have this before?
It compiles fine if I run line by line. Trying to think of a better way to handle large objects when knitting. https://t.co/tERXU61VyL  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1033962943703130112)

> **Suzan Baert** (@SuzanBaert; 7/1): OK, #xaringan wizards/enthusiasts, here's one question I can't find the answer to in documentation or code: can I change the size of the slides? For instance for widescreen projectors? #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1034081412637442048)

> **Jesse Mostipak** (@kierisi; 4/0): @CMastication @SuzanBaert @xieyihui at some point my brain solidified it as "xarnigan" rather than "xaringan" so now I just call it "the really cool slide maker in R"  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1034092189364695041)

<!-- -->


> **Jindra Lacko** (@jladata; 1/1): @SuzanBaert I don't think you can change the slide size, as it depends on output resolution; but you can change the slide ratio in  output:xaringan:nature settings - I believe '16:9' is recognized, as well as '4:3'  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1034086708378329088)
