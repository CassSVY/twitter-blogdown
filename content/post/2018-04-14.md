> **Robert Munk** (@RobMunk; 3/1): Looking for a late afternoon read? How about my first ever blog post: How to Create a Blog with R and Blogdown. The tldr version read "Creating Websites with R Markdown" and don't get fancy. Thanks to @xieyihui, @apreshill, and @ProQuesAsker for the guide!

> **Michael B** (@MichaelBatech; 2/0): Today, I spent 45 minutes making a website in @rstudio  with #blogdown  and then spent 2 hours trying to figure out a PROC IMPORT error in reading a .xlsx file into @SASsoftware . I'm running out of patience for this language and wish it would get it's shit together already.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/984768735612456960)

> **andrea panizza** (@unsorsodicorda; 0/0): @JennyBryan is there a section of https://t.co/LWK4447xlN on managing multiple profiles on the same machine? The "search" box of blogdown is a bit limited. Also, is there a way to print more than 1 chapter at a time? Thanks for your work!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/984716586505375744)

> **andrea panizza** (@unsorsodicorda; 0/0): .@JennyBryan nevermind the first question, I was able to do it myself. BTW, if you think it could be of interest for a general audience, I can submit a PR. I don't know bookdown, but I can write .Rmd docs  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/984787149118738432)

> **Rich Lucas** (@rlucas11; 2/0): @FrederikAust @HeatherUrry Follow-up: I had originally had the knitr option set in one code block and then loaded papaja in the very next block. Moving the line to load papaja into the same block as the knitr option seems to allow me to cache and still render properly.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/984725093933821952)

> **Rich Lucas** (@rlucas11; 1/0): @FrederikAust @HeatherUrry OK...weird. All of a sudden this started happening to me. After trying different things (admittedly very quickly, so my troubleshooting may be wrong), found that setting global knitr cache option to TRUE led to error you got. Removing allowed it to render again. Are you caching?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/984724390540652544)

> **Henning** (@henningsway; 1/0): My favorite #rstats compiler is knitr. 📝⚒️❓✔️  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/984672490764034048)

> **Martin Modrák** (@modrak_m; 1/0): @shravanvasishth I tried both and currently the killer feature in Word for me is the spell+grammar check. If I had something equations + code heavy, knitr might win again - best tool for the job etc. And publishers mostly screw your formatting so might as well use Word ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/984662820980748289)
