> **Alyssa Goldberg** (@WireMonkey; 2/0): @d4tagirl @Nujcharee @juliasilge @RLadiesNYC No, I'm always too intimidated to talk to anyone at meetups, but I saw your talk on becoming a data scientist at the first @RLadiesNYC I attended and the next one on the same day @zabormetrics demonstrated blogdown. Both were great!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992889871546175488)

> **Davis Vaughan** (@dvaughan32; 6/0): @CMastication Fair enough! I got what I know about xaringan through reading and rereading the sample presentation template and the github issues. Maybe someone should make a bookdown on xaringan like @hrbrmstr did for rtweet.

> **Garrick Aden-Buie** (@grrrck; 4/0): @CMastication I feel your pain! In my experience it‚Äôs easier in xaringan (based on remarkjs) to define and apply custom styles. But easier is relative, I still spend way to much time in chrome inspector digging around. Hoping my pkg makes discovering/changing theme less painful.

> **Larie** (@lariebyrd; 3/0): @CMastication Oh man, I know. When I first attempted to use xaringan, I spent forever trial-and-erroing the css - I tried to comment a file here as an example because I don‚Äôt think I could do it again. https://t.co/FwbZBQDAPu  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992900286732820483)

> **Brandon Hurr** (@bhive01; 3/0): @jhollist @LauraJaneGraham OMG. I‚Äôm doing a pretty important presentation in Xaringan and I wish I had given up a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve wasted so much time tweaking CSS and HTML to get the look I want. We‚Äôll see how it goes this week. Maybe the most important presentation of my life. üò¨  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992815494943002625)

> **Jennifer Thompson** (@jent103; 3/0): @grrrck @dvaughan32 @CMastication This is excellent news. I‚Äôve been thinking I need to try xaringan, but I like things *just so* (and don‚Äôt know CSS, nor do I have a particular desire to learn). That‚Äôs what‚Äôs holding me back.

> **Mike Kearneyüìä** (@kearneymw; 2/0): @annasdtc There are a couple rmarkdown templates/wrappers of HTML presentation front ends that render some nice equations‚Äìmy fav is xaringan https://t.co/poj2I5gXEM.

> **Robert M Flight** (@rmflight; 2/0): This looks like an awesome package for modifying the theme of a xaringan presentation without having to know CSS.

I know I always want a larger default font, but then smaller on some slides due to space restrictions. https://t.co/gppaJBphoA  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992756510643183617)

> **Jeff Hollister** (@jhollist; 2/0): @LauraJaneGraham I use xaringan too.  Best option in my opinion, but customizing slide layout, image sizing, changing fonts etc. is a drag!  I'd love to jump between a rmd and a visual editor!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992744483300216832)

> **JD Long** (@CMastication; 2/0): @grrrck this seems like a great idea. I tried xaringan almost immediately after my first rpres attempt yesterday. I could not find my ass with both hands wrt style. This seems a really good idea.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992743373365706752)

> **Laura Graham** (@LauraJaneGraham; 2/0): @jhollist I made some lecture slides using xaringan this week and it was much easier to get nice looking slides. Still not interactive slide building though.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992743255627452416)

<!-- -->


> **Robert M Flight** (@rmflight; 1/0): @bhive01 @CMastication @hrbrmstr @jhollist @xieyihui Because I think each slide is a div in the html, but that doesn't exist until xaringan translates it, but you could have a special attribute on the table that CSS knows to align it with bottom of the slide div element.

> **Robert M Flight** (@rmflight; 1/0): @hrbrmstr @jhollist @CMastication I too often have figures generated from code, xaringan saves me so much time as I don't have to could anything over, and recopy.

It's all in code, and figure is right there.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992832414778036224)

> **JD Long** (@CMastication; 1/0): @dvaughan32 I could not find my ass with both hands with xaringan... no idea what's going on. Dropped back to rpres and css... I still need training wheels, obviously :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992743582154022912)

> **Davis Vaughan** (@dvaughan32; 1/0): @CMastication I saw you fork my slides on github. Did you try xaringan? Still custom css needed here and there but I found it more intuitive and a bit easier to customize. Also examples are given here with css templates you can build from https://t.co/1nTdCOBub4  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992741397794033664)

<!-- -->


> **Gavin Simpson** (@ucfagls; 0/0): @CMastication Yeah, &amp; you'll find the same issue with other frameworks. IIRC w xaringan I had to find the default .css &amp; use developer tools to find what I wanted. Easy, if you have web dev skills, arcane mumbo-jumbo otherwise  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992869599145213952)
