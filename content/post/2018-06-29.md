> **Hayden** (@HYDNMCDNLD; 1/0): @hadleywickham Will this book (and others) ever be available for download in pdf, mobi or epub format like the Blogdown book? I understand that people can't always release books for free, but I was just curious.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012365261620404224)

That was written before the real R Markdown was born, not even to mention bookdown.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1012347202818232320)

# knitr

> **Omar Wasow** (@owasow; 0/0): @hadleywickham @kjhealy @PrincetonUPress Okay, sold on Rmd+knitr+R for teaching. My sense from others who've made the switch, though, is they're still mixing in a fair amount of latex for things like formulas, regression tables, certain typographical elements, bibtex, table refs, etc. So, Rmd as wrapper or really 100%?
