> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 2/0): @shahronak47 @dataandme The first time you call blogdown:::serve_site(), you will see the URL in the console (including the port number). See ?servr::server_config for more info about the port number. When things don't work in RStudio Viewer, always try a real browser.

> **RONAK SHAH** (@shahronak47; 1/1): @xieyihui @dataandme How can we embed tweets with images in blogdown ? When I do blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1014492923981803521') it renders the tweet however, the image is not shown , it gives URL of the image "pic.twitter.123xyz" and doesn't render the image itself. #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1014510534580842496)

> **RONAK SHAH** (@shahronak47; 1/0): @dataandme @xieyihui yes, I saw this post of yours and it has got all the tweets with images. https://t.co/xQUPAoqyWR . I am previewing it in R Studio viewer actually, so I don't think any browser extension would conflict?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1014511621534695425)

> **Murray David Neuzerling** (@mdneuzerling; 1/0): Can I just say how super easy it was to set up a website with Blogdown? Excluding some super specific hosting requirements, I could have had my site running and with SSL in 1--2 hours, with little prior experience. That's just good quality software.

> **Bruna Wundervald** (@bwundervald; 1/0): @MiguelCos Are you familiar with blogdown and/or the hugo academic theme? Some examples of websites built with this theme are https://t.co/u7kuGa1YJb and https://t.co/axRIRnYVol  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1014577875251494912)

> **Miguel Cosenza** (@MiguelCos; 0/0): @SotilloJavi That's an interesting option. It seems like it doesn't require to configure anything such as blogdown or Hugo. Am I right?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1014679587991715842)

<!-- -->


> **Miguel Cosenza** (@MiguelCos; 0/0): @bwundervald Hello Bruna. I know about blogdown and Hugo but I'm still about to learn how to start and maintain the blog. I will take a look at yours and hopefully gather some ideas. Thanks!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1014584250862047239)

# bookdown

> **Dan Egan ü§ì** (@daniel_egan; 0/0): @fortelabs Markdown with a bit of customization goes a long way. Check out bookdown, for example.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1014587166033432576)

# knitr

> **Jonathan Minton** (@JonMinton; 1/1): Quick @RStudio tip: if you use markdown in Projects, but don't want dozens of docs in the base dir, you can put the .rmd docs in a subdir then include the following as first chunk:
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '../')
(Something I remembered, forgot, and have rediscovered!)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1014448312559308801)

Is there a way to do something similar with remark/xaringan, or does that go beyond the scope of remark?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1014624292254826496)
