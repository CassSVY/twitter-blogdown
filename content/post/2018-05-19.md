> **Alistair Bailey** (@alistair604; 5/3): After reading @dsquintana and @lbusetto74 excellent tweets, I made my own website: https://t.co/IpolQwXSZF and wrote down how I did it: https://t.co/sdLoMfmQxz I do my citations in JabRef so I tweaked Lorezno's super useful function to handle JabRef output. #rtsats, #blogdown  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/997463729502552065)

> **O anartista** (@Guto_Barros; 0/0): @inconvergent For the most, I use InDesign. If it contains math &amp; code, I would try the package bookdown in R.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/997411377919733760)

# knitr

> **Will Landau** (@wmlandau; 1/0): @CFHammill @halifaxtim @avehtari @betanalpha @jim_savage_ @JennyBryan @kwbroman R-focused pipelines with knitr reports are easier with drake than with Make + rmarkdown. drake automatically searches active code chunks for dependencies from elsewhere in the pipeline. Code: https://t.co/FqGNKudnHb. Tutorial: https://t.co/nBGP0R1NcA.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/997612340613910529)

> **\mathfrak{Michael Betancourt}** (@betanalpha; 1/0): @halifaxtim As great as Rmarkdown and knitr are they are, in my opinion, still a little immature in a few places that can make incorporating them into pipelines a bit tricky.  I always knit from the command line (to ensure a completely clean R environment) and then share HTML/PDFs.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/997554334845030400)

> **Deemah üá∫üá¶  üá≥üá¥** (@dmi3k; 1/0): @dselivanov_ Neither of this (readxl, DBI, knitr/rmd/hugo) is easy. Agree that, some people don't need to write posts - they write long and good vignettes instead. I am eternally grateful for your awesome  https://t.co/ngHKofA5Do and https://t.co/WeBjK35bhs manuals. üôè  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/997452824643502080)

# xaringan

> **Pavel Filatov** (@filatov_py; 2/0): @taraskaduk @tableau @rstudio After R it seems unintuitive. Urghh... Happily I have a freedom doing reports. And @xieyihu's xaringan is awesome for this task! Just awesome. I saw you use it too)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/997588163680985088)
