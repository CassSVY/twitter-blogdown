> **Murray David Neuzerling** (@mdneuzerling; 1/0): This is a new challenge for me: self-hosting a website on a VPS. Blogdown and Hugo made that super easy (cc: @jubtrig check out Hugo!) The next step is to automate deployment via git.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1013537625435541504)

> **Corey Pembleton** (@coreypembleton; 0/0): So I'd like to try to follow @badatreality's system of building another hugo site within my #blogdown site, @xieyihui @apreshill do you see me encountering problems following what he did in this blog? https://t.co/e89BWofPGe  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1013455562640683011)

# knitr

> **Michael** (@PessimisticPhD; 1/0): I love #rstats but am not sure the feeling is mutual. Does anyone know why the psych::describe function is incompatible with #rmarkdown? I keep getting errors where it doesn't recognize defined objects in my workspace, leaving me unable to use knitr to export it as a pdf/doc  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1013268363227860993)
