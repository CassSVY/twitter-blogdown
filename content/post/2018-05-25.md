> **Thomas Klebel** (@klebel_t; 2/1): @hrbrmstr Do you happen to know any example of of a blogdown site that is GDPR compliant? I’d like to take a few steps into that direction, but the task is a bit daunting and obviously has some pitfalls like the one above...

> **Nate Day** (@natedayta; 2/0): @xieyihui @apreshill Ty but it really was just my tweaks to the Minimal theme, that spiraled out of control. I blame the #blogdown docs for being too helpful 🤣  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/999705128675487746)

> **Victor Ordu** (@BroVic; 0/1): So I built my site with 'blogdown' and hugo according to instructions (hopefully) and it's telling me 'Page Not Found'. Tomorrow we try again. #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/999786514136649728)

> **Thomas Klebel** (@klebel_t; 0/0): @hrbrmstr Sorry for the unspecific q 😁 it is hosted on netlify. But I’d probably need at least a cookie notice (google analytics), social buttons are problematic and what about disqus? Setting up a blog with blogdown was easy, but those issues add a lot of complexity  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/999685088794365958)
