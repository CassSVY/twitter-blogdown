> **Daniel Hadley** (@danielphadley; 3/0): Also, shout out to @ProQuesAsker for having my favorite brand of any Blogdown website I have seen: https://t.co/gm9dX2nY1c  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978775606379757568)

> **Larie** (@lariebyrd; 3/0): OK, this is potentially a dumb question, but I can't quite figure out how to google it, lol. If I want to create a blogdown post that utilizes an external dataset...where do I put the dataset? How do I call it? I can't seem to find an example right now, too.

> **Austin Wehrwein** (@awhstin; 0/0): I recently messed with the meta tags on my website and these examples were excellent/useful so take a look if you are thinking of 'socializing' your website https://t.co/dALreLH2Rk  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978640127802138624)

# bookdown

> **Garrett Grolemund** (@StatGarrett; 1/0): @ericpgreen @minebocek I think your best bet would be to insert a learnr tutorial into bookdown with include_url(). That's what bookdown recommends for shinyapps, https://t.co/n4o6UxZQqo  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978751747849179136)

> **Andrew Mercer** (@awmercer; 1/0): @hadleywickham @kjhealy I just finished writing my PhD dissertation entirely in bookdown/@rstudio, and it was excellent in nearly every respect. Spelling and grammar checking was the weak link. Haven't found a great 3rd party solution either.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978723064614719490)

> **Mara Averick** (@dataandme; 1/0): @kjhealy any plans to package up your üòç bookdown look? And, no, I totally *don't* bug friends at Princeton UP about when your book is coming out‚Ä¶despite them telling me that's "not their department." https://t.co/xvPix2MOVA  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978691218363228160)

# knitr

> **Thomas Mock** (@thomas_mock; 1/0): @lariebyrd There were 2 or 3 ways of doing it, I used here to set relative path to my dataset. You could also host externally and link as url, or set as a knitr cached chunk.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978778471785730048)

> **David Gohel** (@DavidGohel; 1/0): @IsabellaGhement thanksüòä But to be honest, I feel more like a plumber by using rmarkdown/pandoc and knitr :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978644805143146497)

<!-- -->


> **Daniel Hadley** (@danielphadley; 0/0): Finally, shout out to @xieyihui, whose work on Knitr drove so much progress forward  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978776213392048128)

<!-- -->


> **Avraham Adler** (@AvrahamAdler; 0/0): @hadleywickham I use @JabRef_org religiously. Since it saves in #bibtex/#biblatex it's a breeze to use with #LaTeX/#knitr and useable in #Rmd as well.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978754126363455488)

# xaringan

> **David F. Severski** (@dseverski; 0/1): Having way too much fun with the Xaringan package by @xieyihui. Sneaking in a little color commentary (that will unfortunately have to be removed on go live) at the end of this deck. #rstats https://t.co/2iPpjLGVjO  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978775841835397120)
