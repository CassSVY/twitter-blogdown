# blogdown

> **Jorge Camoes** (@wisevis; 5/0): I desperately need to play with #blogdown and other cool #rstats packages instead of finishing this thing I'm doing now that can actually pay some bills.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1003180933233758209)

> **Stacey Smith** (@iochromaland; 2/0): @omearabrian My first thought upon reading this reply, was 'well, harumph' and also 'what the heck is blogdown'.  Which I suppose only proves that I am an indeed an old fogie.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1003413430735462400)

> **Brian O'Meara** (@omearabrian; 0/1): @iochromaland I mean, you did write a book. An actual one on paper. AND you travel the world collecting organisms. The new systematists use blogdown and impute their trees. ;-)

# knitr

> **Travis Gerke** (@travisgerke; 3/0): @thosjleeper I have often had this same thought; recently stumbled on the finalfit ðŸ“¦ from @ewenharrison which has nicely suited many of my needs. Worth a look!

> **Pavel Iosad** (@anghyflawn; 1/0): @VerbingNouns @sj2915 @kev_watson Hedges: you can do the R bit equally well in both because knitr is amazing; Iâ€™ve been a LaTeX user for over 12 years so take anything I say with that in mind.

> **Luke Sonnet** (@LukeSonnet; 0/0): @guygrossman @rstudio Knitr allows you to interweave R code into native LaTeX, which I find lowers costs for those familiar w latex and R but not markdown.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1003349957611573248)

# xaringan

> **Daniel Anderson** (@datalorax_; 72/20): Yesterday at #cascadiarconf I officially announced my WIP #rstats package, slidex, for converting PPTX slides to #xaringan.

> **Carlos** (@coforfe; 0/0): This package is a work-in-progress, but is aimed at making the process of converting Microsoft PowerPoint slides to beautiful HTML xaringan slides as seamless as possible, maintaining tables,figures, links, and bulleted lists. https://t.co/ScSvxN7mWM https://t.co/TMPoVY3HuO  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1003399699263614976)
