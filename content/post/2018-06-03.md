> **Thomas Lumley** (@tslumley; 11/1): This blogdown/netlify combination is a very civilised way to blog.

If only someone had developed it before I had lotsa posts to convert.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1002795504000905216)

It went much smoother than last time. blogdown + netlify + rbind. @road2stat was really helpful via the rbind issues page getting my site deployed. I needed @apreshill's detailed notes on netlify.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1002820599926775809)

> **Jason Ferrell** (@nullrejector; 0/0): I've wanted to start a blog for a long time. Now that I have some job stability, it's time. What is your preferred blogging platform, and why?  Also, anyone particularly like (or not) using blogdown in R?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1002973653733203970)

> **Joran Elias** (@joranelias; 0/0): @pheski Yeah, blogdown has been around for a while. Never had a reason to use it myself, but I have experience with several other of his R pckages and he‚Äôs very good. I‚Äôve heard good things about it.

# knitr

> **Omar Wasow** (@owasow; 1/0): @btleyden @JohnHolbein1 This was an issue for some of my undergrads last semester who wrote in Word, copy &amp; pasted to RStudio and then compiled Latex+knitr. There really ought to be a Latex package that could simplify use of curly quotes, &lt;, &gt; and underscores for beginners.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1002985587689730048)
