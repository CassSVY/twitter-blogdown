> **Roger D. Peng** (@rdpeng; 3/0): @MilesMcBain One thing interesting about this question is that as more and more non-coding activity happens in RStudio (blogdown, pkgdown, bookdown), the need for a really nice fixed-width font only grows.

> **Brianna** (@fossilosophy; 3/0): @kierisi I am cozied up with a cup of tea working on my blogdown site, thanks to you and @thomas_mock (though sometimes when fighting with errors I'm not sure whether to thank you ðŸ˜‚)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/993135901478936576)

> **Sheila Saia** (@sheilasaia; 3/0): Slowly but surely converting my #wordpress site to a #blogdown site. Keep thinking about what @xieyihui said at #rstudioconf2018 about using a simple template but it's been an #awesome learning experience trying to get the academic hugo theme working! :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992948979615793152)

> **Brianna** (@fossilosophy; 2/0): @kierisi @thomas_mock You two are the best! So far I've muddled through (I literally *just* figured out how to path a write.csv call so that blogdown actually saved the file and didn't hate me). I will let you guys know next time I get stuck!

> **Jesse Maegan** (@kierisi; 1/0): @fossilosophy @thomas_mock Those error struggles are REAL. Holler if we can help in any way! I've literally broken Hugo + blogdown + Netlify in more ways than should be humanly possible ðŸ˜‚  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/993137409507430400)

# bookdown

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 6/0): @emilbp Yes -- you may want to check the R help page ?bookdown::pdf_book (look for the global option "https://t.co/48721bOXJV.latex") before asking on Twitter :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/992960375162310656)

# xaringan

> **Zack Barnett-Howell** (@zackt_bh; 4/1): Putting the finishing touches on a presentation. Thereâ€™s a new package from @grrrck thatâ€™s a fantastic complement to building slides with #xaringan.

> **Jacquie Tran** (@jacquietran; 3/0): @lariebyrd @ma_salmon @CMastication Ohhh...wish I'd seen this a couple weeks ago when I decided to try xaringan for a presentation on data vis, which involved much css confusion &amp; hard-to-read font colours despite my best efforts!
