> **Tyler Morgan-Wall** (@tylermorganwall; 1/1): 1/7 (thread) With all of this talk about using blogdown for data blogs, I'd just like to say self-hosted Wordpress installs provide immense flexibility and properly configured, can support massive amounts of traffic on the cheapest VPS plans.

> **Tyler Morgan-Wall** (@tylermorganwall; 0/0): 6/7 Definitely a higher barrier to entry than getting a basic blogdown website up, but once running the added flexibility and customization options make up for it. And as blogdown matures, this gap will likely close.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/994599561808277504)

Are you planning to maintain the bookdown version after the physical copy is published ala R for Data Science?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/994534719734902784)

# knitr

> **Mara Averick** (@dataandme; 7/0): @psychemedia I love knitr, it's great —  I was just trying to be all extra and update my TeX and things did not go as planned…  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/994533570797588481)

<!-- -->


> **Mara Averick** (@dataandme; 4/0): @psychemedia Like, I just wish I'd thought of doing it overnight— esp. because (lesson learned) knitting (as in knitr knitting) while you're updating TeX is *not* a great idea.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/994532280273121280)

> **Hao Ye** (@Hao_and_Y; 2/0): Surprisingly few lines of code needed to generate this interactive html table from a google sheet file, thanks to `googlesheets`, `knitr`, and `DT` packages in R! #mozsprint

Who would be the villain who manipulate magrittr and power the dark forces with dpylr #rstats. Only to be saved  (who is the hero??)  in a story told by knitr and DT.

> **Tony Hirst** (@psychemedia; 0/0): @olihawkins You should look at  Rmd. It is  powerful and excellent routes to html, pdf, etc etc output via knitr. Shiny is also a quick win for interactively displaying outputs  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/994552055418228737)

> **Tony Hirst** (@psychemedia; 0/0): @dataandme ! I was looking at pdf workflows from Jupyter today, which I can't get working properly; knitr route feels far more reliable.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/994532643667611648)
