# blogdown

> **Dorris A. Scott** (@Dorris_Scott; 6/3): Day 83 of #100DaysOfCode: Had a combined coding + baking session. Still having the same problems as yesterday and I think the template I chose isn't blogdown friendly. At least my bake(Honey loaf cake) was successful!  https://t.co/iLRXUTCcWP  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1024155998267887616)

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 1/0): @aashish_soneji @rstudio Sorry, but I don't understand your brief question. Are you asking if Jupyter notebooks are qualified for this contest (the answer will be "No"), or if R Markdown notebooks are the same as Jupyter (still "No"). This scope of contest is only on the bookdown package.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1024334084695314432)

# knitr

> **Ruben C. Arslan** (@rubenarslan; 1/0): @rstudio Ok, I can just make this dependent on some setting that pkgdown ignores, e.g. knit_by_pkgdown &lt;- !is.null(knitr::opts_chunk$get("fig.retina"))  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1024234486509318144)

> **Logan J Everett** (@loganjeverett; 0/0): Finally dove into using #knitr today with the help of @kwbroman 's primer and now I'm overwhelmed by the regret of not doing this a long time ago.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1024474125363040257)

> **baptiste** (@baptiste_auguie; 0/0): this workflow, where knitr would become a pandoc filter, would have several advantages: i) inline commented code would not be run (knitr currently finds them with regex, so ignores html comments); ii) more modular workflow, allowing e.g. merging of edits made to the output text  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1024466046986514432)

> **Neil Chalk** (@_neilch; 0/0): Oh, turns out I mistyped .. it's knitr not knittr!! Once the user error was corrected nicely formatted tables were my reward https://t.co/x5LEvlJQcU  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1024363651669614593)

# xaringan

> **Jennifer Thompson** (@jent103; 2/0): @_MMathur Thank you so much - yours was great too, &amp; I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be referring to it!

I did slides w/ xaringan package in R - üëåüèª esp if you already know RMarkdown. Code for the slides is in Rmd file in linked Github repo, &amp; package README is a üíØ starting point: https://t.co/QiYq3idSBt  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1024169641206140928)

> **Jennifer Thompson** (@jent103; 1/0): @_MMathur The *R-created graphics, sorry. I drew all the exposure scenarios in Keynote and exported them. Easy to include separate image files with xaringan.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1024171797573328897)
