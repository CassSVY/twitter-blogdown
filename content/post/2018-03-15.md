> **Darren L Dahly** (@statsepi; 10/4): Still very much a work in progress, but here is our new website. It's amazing how easy #blogdown #rstudio #rstats makes this. https://t.co/ex5SnEcgS3 (feedback always welcome) @B_A_Palmer  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973839692880928768)

# knitr

> **John Ray** (@johnlray; 1/0): @bryanmwilcox @tylerreny @hadleywickham If it's being launched through some other process, either store the path in an object you call within the session or use here::here() which defaults to the top-level project directory but can easily be set elsewhere. If it's a project, likely knitr::opts will help you too.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973969363073224706)

# xaringan

The Hygge "theme"(https://t.co/rQFMB1HiCa ) is such a cool add on too! This could definitely be a rabbit hole... But UO theme coming soon!

> **John Blischak** (@jdblischak; 1/0): I'd been avoiding installing LaTeX on my macOS and Windows machines b/c it's always such a hassle. Just learned about about TinyTeX today and easily got setup on both machines. Thanks @xieyihui! https://t.co/S6bAacImh6  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/974066342780461056)
