> **Ma√´lle Salmon üêü** (@ma_salmon; 5/0): @DrMowinckels I'm actually thinking I'd like a blogdown option on my blog to have the direct link to the source file to edit, so that people can more easily fix my own typos!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1011222706380034048)

> **Simon Grund** (@simongrund89; 1/0): For those interested: The site was build with Hugo and blogdown for R (credit 
@xieyihui). The theme is based on Hyde, with way too much time sunk into modification (no regrets ü§ò).  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1011351122026598400)

> **Dr. Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 1/0): @ma_salmon @DrMowinckels I just made a new post-specific params variable called "raw" and after pushing to github I copy/pasted the link I wanted back into the YAML. I tested that if I left "raw" out of the YAML it still worked ü§ì https://t.co/3zshAUhyl6  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1011261875747577856)

> **Dr. Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 1/0): @ma_salmon @DrMowinckels I edited one of the layouts for the blogdown demo site to add a "view raw" button- you could do that with a github editable link? https://t.co/kWsR4JyqQH https://t.co/c5rASBlDZI  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1011259048040124416)

> **Ma√´lle Salmon üêü** (@ma_salmon; 1/0): @DrMowinckels cc @apreshill is there already an easy way to add an "edit me here" button to blogdown post?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1011247726070255619)

Which reminds me that I might need to change to blogdown to have those nice cards when sharing a blog post.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1011270349454041091)

# knitr

> **Sylvain Chab√©-Ferret** (@SylvainCF; 9/0): In case it might be of interest, I uploaded to my research webpage a pdf explaining my ideal workflow for collaborative reproducible research and how to set it up : knitr (R+Latex) + Git + MySQL (might become a blog post at some point) :)

> **Sylvain Chab√©-Ferret** (@SylvainCF; 0/0): @andreamatranga @abhishekn In order to save on computational time, I use the awesome knitr 'cache' option, that stores a local version of the results from big computations on my computer.
