> **Kaelen L. Medeiros** (@kaelen_medeiros; 5/0): I've had a lot of new followers lately, which motivated me to update my website. It's still not blogdown and I have about 4 blog entries planned that aren't written, but as they say, something is better than nothing: https://t.co/3ptXrv6WDm  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/961805862401536000)

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 2/0): @_StuartLee @AndreaCirilloAC @timelyportfolio I love the theme, too. I bet it is a customized version of the default theme in blogdown (i.e. hugo-lithium).  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/961822739475546113)

> **Larie** (@lariebyrd; 1/0): I cannot for the life of me figure out how to change the logo in the blogdown template - I just stuck with the simplest default one. Does anyone have any tips? I tried to modify it and it broke, lol #blogdown  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/962019251849605126)

> **Jeremy R. Winget** (@_jwinget; 1/0): Thanks to @xieyihui's talk at #rstudioconf, my first website is now live! I made the entire site from scratch (using RStudio and the blogdown package), and it only took 2 days! Bit more content to add, but check out the initial deployment:

> **Sergio** (@ibarraespinosa1; 1/0): #rstats  #Bookdown is it good idea to have an 'in-development' book on github before finishing it?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/962032170800791552)

> **Marie Dussault ðŸ’€** (@londonaesthetik; 0/0): @lariebyrd Ya the html is tricky. I read the appendix in bookdown but am not ready tackle that, so theme change it was! I *did* managed to tweak the CSS to get the right text colours though!!!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/962033586940600320)
