# blogdown

> **Dilsher  Dhillon** (@TexanDhillon; 0/0): Twitter fam - I need recommendations on creating a data science blog. I intend to include both R and python tutorials. R blogdown is an option but would it support python tutorials as well? #rstats @BecomingDataSci @dataandme @chrisalbon @hadleywickham  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1035547515792318464)

# bookdown

> **John Coene** (@jdatap; 13/4): ü§ó to push the {sigmajs} üì¶ to CRAN, I truly hope it helps the #rstats community as much as it helps me. I genuinely believe it brings a lot to visualising networks in R. I‚Äôve overdone the docs with #pkgdown and #bookdown in an effort to make it all clear.

> **Hiroaki Yutani** (@yutannihilat_en; 2/2): TIL: usethis::use_rmarkdown_template() does all the things to create an R Markdown template, which I can't remember and always google around. Nice! #rstats  https://t.co/pod0vvgy9U  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1035529938739159041)

> **Christopher Harms üá™üá∫** (@chrisharms; 0/0): RStudio is nice for writing pure R code, but I writing bookdown/RMarkdown feels better in VSCode. Unfortunately, no R or RMarkdown support in VSCode yet. Hopefully, Microsoft will release RTVS for VSCode soon (https://t.co/N55tWjDouw).

# knitr

> **Jennifer Thompson** (@jent103; 1/0): @stephhazlitt That's a great way to look at it! Mine is from when I was primarily using knitr + Latex (vs Rmd) so I'm struggling with some overflow errors and control sequences üôÉ but will think these happy thoughts!

> **Sabrina Arias** (@sabrinabarias; 0/0): Help please- does anyone know how to change the line spacing of an abstract in the YAML of an RMD document? (The rest of the paper is specified as - \usepackage{setspace}\doublespacing, but I'd like the abstract alone to be \singlespacing) #rmarkdown #knitr  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1035555917243338752)

> **3nrique0** (@3nrique0; 0/0): To use or not to use #Notebooks. This is a very informed opinion, and to be sincere I've been laughing like a kid watching cartoons AND learning stuff I ignored. I wonder if #Rmd and #knitr hide similar problems. -- I'll have to give it a try https://t.co/LAzAUC055F  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1035545386860068866)

> **Silas Tittes** (@SilasTittes; 0/0): All the examples I can find online use Sweave and Knitr, which opens a can of worms when it comes to writing manuscripts to submit to journals.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1035372846829076480)

> **Michael Pawlus** (@michaelpawlus; 1/0): Didn't end up doing as much python work as I wanted but worked some into my #ApraDAS2018 presentation where I also used {xaringan} for the first time (which was a definite open goal). Chaired a conference that saw 50% increase in attendance. All in all, a good #SoDS  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1035539756862455808)

# yihui.name

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 0/0): @Offshore16 You must have turned on the chunk option tidy = TRUE, which uses formatR, and formatR failed to format your code. For possible reasons, see Section 6: https://t.co/U9SyveVvQu  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1035533488802459648)
