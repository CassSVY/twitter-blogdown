# blogdown

> **Kim Fitter** (@Kim_Fitter; 10/3): Git has been a little elusive to me so I wrote a #blogdown about üåØ crepes made with git (or should it be with  grit? :) https://t.co/G3IV8RCdF8  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978852836883812357)

> **Larie** (@lariebyrd; 10/0): YOU GUYS I wrote a package; it generates edgelists and nodelists for network graphs. I also wrote a blog post walking through its use with the @FiveThirtyEight "candy" dataset to create a network graph showing candy similarities: https://t.co/Qg4DNJMaCm #rstats #blogdown https://t.co/WroohGALJJ  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979395738600968192)

I'm just starting with blogdown and blogging in general. Post is aimed for people who've never used R who might like a few setup tips.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979038571368734720)

> **Alison Hill** (@apreshill; 1/0): @ProQuesAsker @michael_chirico @lariebyrd Yes thank you @ProQuesAsker! And @lariebyrd not a dumb question at all, post was inspired by GitHub issues from multiple users and this question on @rstudio community: https://t.co/Qr3vo4fx2K https://t.co/RuclYG3BBx  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979008760562659328)

I already have the standard month/week blocky calendar iframe widget working, but it looks like crap and hard to read individual events.

> **√Ångel Vergara Cruces** (@ngelVerCru; 5/1): My working phylosophy! (sometimes)

This is from Mastering Software Development in R https://t.co/83rxtUy4jC Wonderful book so far, definitely worth reading if you want to learn more about R and get introduced to useful packages! https://t.co/6zE6q2lb5T  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/978924103829770241)

<!-- -->


> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 4/0): @f2harrell @nicoleradziwill We will be there, but definitely won't fully reinvent LaTeX with Rmd, which means there will be a point where we'll stop. For now, bookdown has a simple implementation of cross-refs; tufte has marginal notes. Not sure what you want re: bibliographies and text formatting.

> **Nicole Radziwill** (@nicoleradziwill; 2/1): Dear #rstats community... if you were going to get @xieyihui 's "Bookdown" or "Dynamic Documents" books, and you could only get one right now, which one would you get?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979053295275782144)

<!-- -->


> **Jaime Ashander** (@jaimedash; 2/0): @f2harrell @xieyihui @nicoleradziwill just install it and add this to the yaml of an Rmd, and change the cross-references https://t.co/Fdx6vI7JPW \m/ https://t.co/bwsWlP2m9b  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979427538194677760)

> **Frank Harrell** (@f2harrell; 1/0): @jaimedash @xieyihui @nicoleradziwill Yes I've looked at bookdown.  It's appealing because the defaults are nice.  But fine control of formatting isn't really there.  Even books published with bookdown (paper copies) don't look quite polished enough.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979456735969792000)

> **Tony Hirst** (@psychemedia; 0/0): ok.. so I properly need to checkout bookdown https://t.co/MKmhdyYiCY Wondering if OpenCreate proj did full eval of things like this at start and maintains a scan of how projects like this are evolving?

> **Jaime Ashander** (@jaimedash; 0/0): @f2harrell @xieyihui @nicoleradziwill have you tried bookdown Frank? it's awesome and does most of what you need (and you can drop raw latex in at will =)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979426758330957824)

> **Martin Skarzynski** (@marskar; 8/0): @CMastication Python in R markdown is so awesome. Thank you @xieyihui @hadleywickham @jcheng @winston_chang @kevin_ushey @rstudio @TerryTangYuan @aronatkins @jmcphers @javierluraschi @fly_upside_down et al. for knitr, rmarkdown &amp; reticulate. Rmd will be the standard for scientific publication.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979080503390240768)

> **Emily Josephs** (@emjosephs; 5/1): @corlettwwood I really like using Rstudio + knitr to make markdown files with chunks of R code, bash code, figures, etc. Also, README files in every folder with the scripts that were used to make the files in that folder (tip from @AdrianPlatts).  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979483596405792768)

> **Shravan Vasishth** (@shravanvasishth; 3/0): i am looking forward to a day when i can write a knitr Rnw file and expect that it will work across OSes. A co-author makes some small changes, the Rnw file stops compiling.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979421189880852480)

> **Christian Goebel** (@Chri5tianGoebel; 3/0): @ingorohlfing @marcfbellemare I recommend Scrivener by @ScrivenerApp. Best of all worlds. Much nicer writing than either Word or LaTeX, works with Zotero, lets you compile into LaTeX, multimarkdown, Word, whatever. Insert R or Python code into .tex file, compile with KnitR or PyLaTeX, done.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979390983375851521)

> **Jan Katins** (@jankatins; 2/0): @CMastication As I see a 'https://t.co/ofuBO3oQuL()' -&gt; it shows normal markdown images in the final document? Also: is state preserved beween chunks? E.g. will the next python code chunk be ale to access df in that example? If so, we have finally a knitr for python :-)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979278748846624770)

> **Corlett Wolfe Wood** (@corlettwwood; 1/0): @emjosephs @AdrianPlatts Yeah, README files are key...thank you!  RStudio + knitr are also awesome :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979489399904849920)

> **Jordi G. ||*||** (@jguillaumes; 0/0): @CMastication Is that usable in a jupyter notebook? Afaik it is not posible to use two kernels from a notebook, so I guess this is only for knitr.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979278131566727169)

> **Jake Russ** (@JakeRuss; 0/0): Hey #rstats, I recall RStudio giving control over output directories for knitr/Rmarkdown docs, but I can't find a link. Anyone know where this is at?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/979012385578078208)
