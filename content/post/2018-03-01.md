> **Mara Averick** (@dataandme; 4/0): @xieyihui @mmmpork @apreshill @kierisi It's so easy to get sucked down a (fun) rabbit hole though… The blogdown code is incredibly readable, so 🙏 thank you thank you for that!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/968878379268231168)

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 3/1): @mmmpork @apreshill @kierisi @dataandme That is totally fine to me. As I said in the blogdown book, there are very legitimate reasons to use rmarkdown::render_site(): https://t.co/MAHaTLyuh9 You don't have to wrestle with Hugo. Use whatever works for you.

I've often wondered if it's more efficient to have a separate GitHub repo per project and have my blogdown site pull in the CSV from that repo (as opposed to keeping the CSVs from lots of different projects all on my site itself). Love seeing these options! https://t.co/543zPSxXwr  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/968908879215001600)

> **Miguel Bento** (@theporra; 0/0): @londonaesthetik Congrats, and great post. My domain is setup, just working on the blogdown structure and have started writing my first post (also an origin story 😊)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/968883491961176064)

> **Jesse Maegan** (@kierisi; 9/0): not only did @_omahdi find a small bug in knitr, he opened a GH issue, filed a PR, *and* learned about reprex()! in his words, "this awesome community and the February challenge encouraged me to share my findings and turn them into a little contribution instead" 🙌🙌🙌  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/968668939675951106)

> **Colin Fay** (@_ColinFay; 1/0): @Chucheria Yep, knitr engines are amazingly customizable (knitr never ceases to amaze me), and you can mimic almost any command line tool, so cypher is doable :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/968978874297212928)

<!-- -->


> **Colin Fay** (@_ColinFay; 0/0): @Chucheria This engine is simply wrapping up the chunk code inside a system call to cypher, with the cypher-shell bin path, user name and password given as knitr options. 
I'll 📦 this up in a few 🙃  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/968978975170220032)
