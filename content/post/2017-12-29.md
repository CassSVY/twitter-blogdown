A side request is to build a website, I guess blogdown will do the job. Is mixing those 3 in the same project ok ? #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/946308163007115265)

Thank you for this package!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/946231655479566337)

> **Nicolas Roelandt** (@RoelandtN42; 0/0): @road2stat @xieyihui My project is due in 2 weeks, so I plan to set xarigan and blogdown during the holidays. So if you remember, started from liftr  and I put everything into a docs/ folder. I wonder if I can make a presentations folder and a blog one into that folder too. Or aside...

I wasn't thinking something like that. for Xaringan, it makes more sense because we often write a paper and do some presentations about it.

For Blogdown, it might have an interest too, for cases like mine.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/946346333677514752)
