It has an inordinate amount of great advice for when things are going awry. üëè to @xieyihui @ProQuesAsker &amp; @apreshill.

Read.csv constantly threw errors and I found a post about importing data for blogdown and it used read_csv so I switched.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/980829241012113408)
