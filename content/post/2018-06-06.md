# blogdown

> **Wenlong Liu** (@tianya0423; 4/0): Easy and convenient way to built my own website (https://t.co/pU60EDTjLu) using #blogdown. Thanks for @xieyihui for the amazing package and also @georgecushen for the Hugo Theme #hugoacademic.  The website is hosted at Github pages for free. #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1004042409620189184)

> **Chester Ismay** (@old_man_chester; 1/0): @apreshill @sckottie @VickySteeves I‚Äôm gonna continue the chain here and tag @xieyihui since I‚Äôm not sure. I have to imagine that functionality was not included in bookdown since it wouldn‚Äôt be available in PDF or other formats though, but I‚Äôm not sure.

> **Ben Marwick** (@benmarwick; 0/0): @VickySteeves No worries, I think what they use is something that they hope to turn into lessondown (https://t.co/MTL1xSwiLV). I'm not sure that it's bookdown at all, but it's very well documented: https://t.co/lWkmlk0J1J  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1004047355706933248)
