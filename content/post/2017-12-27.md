> **DivyaJyoti Rajdev** (@DivjyotiRajdev; 2/1): I can't get over the amazing fact that vignettes have detailed bookdowns! See tidytext bookdown for example https://t.co/Nv6r8OUk2o #rstats #r4ds @juliasilge @drob  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/945512200814452736)

> **Dan MacLean** (@danmaclean; 1/0): @AnthonyC1Nash @JohannaRhodes Definitely, it's just a really convenient way to structure large documents and apply as much/little latex as you like. Look up the Rstudio bookdown package and PanDoc program if you would like info about the flexibility of the pipeline.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/945686410690027520)

> **Mareviv** (@maureviv; 0/0): ✅ If you use Sweave, it’s time you switched to knitr. You’ll find that the transition is easy. 
(but I still miss Sweave!) 
✅ You can put underscores in names.
