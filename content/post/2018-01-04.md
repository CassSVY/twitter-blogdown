> **Ted Laderas** (@tladeras; 22/3): Working on moving my GitHub Page over to blogdown: https://t.co/79mJcy32AW Thanks to @apreshill and her wonderful blogdown workshop! https://t.co/WceUEfNSbp  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948435393090805761)

Good night #rstats lovely people üò¥ https://t.co/3zJuzVTRo8  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948687189164068864)

> **Ted Laderas** (@tladeras; 1/0): @datapointier @apreshill Lol. I only charge $5K to do so. ;) hugo has a jekyll import command which works pretty well. I'd start a blogdown site and then use import. Happy to show you what I did.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948637644241555456)

> **Tony McGovern** (@tonmcg; 1/0): @Nujcharee Congrats. Great content. I hope your upcoming posts will feature an embedded #PowerBI app.

Interestingly, I was watching Yihui Xie's video on how to use blogdown to make websites at the exact moment this tweet popped in my TL. Looks fantastic!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948570087321108480)

I‚Äôm really a total newbie when it comes to website stuff, so I‚Äôm probably doing a terrible job describing what blogdown is.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948561398543650816)

> **Nujcharee (‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πá‡∏î)** (@Nujcharee; 0/0): @tonmcg Thank you. You should try blogdown for sure - easy to publish via netlify :)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948571267615154177)

> **Frank Harrell** (@f2harrell; 0/0): @LeafyEricScott Thanks Eric.  I see a program for converting https://t.co/7Gg8xRv92j blogs (after exporting to xml) to Hugo.  I assume you can then modify Hugo to blogdown.  If I made the change I'd change my google site that works with https://t.co/7Gg8xRv92j to use the new stuff.

> **Eric Scott** (@LeafyEricScott; 0/0): @f2harrell It uses the Academic theme for Hugo. https://t.co/S27MVRqw4W.  I don‚Äôt think Hugo/blogdown works with https://t.co/hjCqLSn5GB.  It‚Äôs a static site generator‚Äîyou have to be able to upload folders of .html files and such.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948557064082731008)

> **Frank Harrell** (@f2harrell; 0/0): @LeafyEricScott Beautiful layout.  Would you be willing to share the template you are using?  Anyone know whether blogdown can be used in conjunction with a 'packaged' blog system like https://t.co/7Gg8xRv92j?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948522231541501953)

> **BIgflower Francis** (@bigflowertien; 0/0): @NicholasStrayer  Could you help me out?  The "tuftesque blogdown theme" cannot be displayed in my github page.  I build my blogs successfully by following your clear instructions. Thanks a lot.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948486464991457280)

A graph thought- as the composition varies weekly depending on the Twitter recent corpus (I would not expect to be named most weeks) it could make a really pretty time series animation  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948644484228657152)

# knitr

> **Martin John Hadley** (@martinjhnhadley; 4/0): @SteffLocke @ma_salmon I never knew about knitr::purl that‚Äôs really useful üòé  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948591196389167105)

<!-- -->


> **Ma√´lle Salmon üêü** (@ma_salmon; 2/0): @martinjhnhadley In that case after writing the whole Rmd for the post one could automatically produce the corresponding .R via knitr::purl? I think it's good to intertwine the code with text in the blog post itself?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/948590346119864320)
