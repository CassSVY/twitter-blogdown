# blogdown

> **Emerson Del Ponte** (@edelponte; 12/3): The @OpenPlantPath academic community website is powered by #blogdown using the amazing Academic @GoHugoIO theme by @georgecushen @and is deployed by @Netlify https://t.co/jTr3sbm1bF  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/953798162820534275)

> **Jesse Maegan** (@kierisi; 1/0): @chrisgalgojr very cool! you can do all of these things with R - making a website via blogdown, doing analysis and visualization work with R, or even creating a web app with Shiny (still in the R family).

# bookdown

> **Torkild H. Lyngstad** (@torkildl; 1/0): @factistic Exactly! Just started a book project in bookdown actually. And making Rmd templates for various types of ms.Fonts only real problem left.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/954097868377292802)

> **Sebastian Schnettler** (@factistic; 1/0): @torkildl I just recently discovered, or at least started using, RMarkdown/Pandoc from within RStudio when a student in class drew my attention to it. Since, the commented syntax files I provide after class are waaaay nicer. And my next book will be in bookdown.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/954094899250556928)

# knitr

> **David Hagmann** (@davidhagmann; 0/0): @polesasunder One reason for keeping separate .R files in my work with @EmilyHHo was so we could refer to variables that are computed later (e.g. to include coefficients from two studies in a table with Study 1). But we just learned of knitr::load_cache() -- super useful!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/954128425257787392)
