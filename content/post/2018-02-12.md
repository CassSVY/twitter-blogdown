> **Scott Reeves** (@DataSciScott; 0/0): @AmeliaMN @xieyihui blogdown is cool but for my simple uses Hugo needs more non-bloggy templates. As yet I'm sticking with straight markdown.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/962807859401646080)

> **Aliakbar Akbaritabar** (@Akbaritabar; 0/0): @healthandstats @rstatsbot1234 @rstudio It is great to read this! And comments!
So I am not alone ;) 
I have been writing quite everything with Rmarkdown and git/GitHub makes is so much easier to keep track of things and report what is going on in different versions.
Did you use "bookdown" to compile the final report?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/962654443710943232)

# knitr

> **Susannah Cowtan** (@SuusJC; 1/0): @wmlandau @rOpenSci Like the look of the package; do you have an example you could post in the docs of using it with latex in knitr?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/962682129606938625)

<!-- -->


> **Will Landau** (@wmlandau; 0/0): @SuusJC @rOpenSci Are you looking for a solution with LaTeX specifically? Those examples should work the same if your knitr report is an Rnw rather than an Rmd.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/962688040748699648)
