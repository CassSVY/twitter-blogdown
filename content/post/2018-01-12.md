> **Jim Hester** (@jimhester_; 3/1): @polesasunder I think the short answer is use `blogdown::serve_site()`, not build site https://t.co/kJPyXgtt6m  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951575912553893890)

> **Andrew MacDonald** (@polesasunder; 3/1): hey #rstats, quick #blogdown question: Does it *have* to rebuild every single Rmd every time you run blogdown::build_site() ? Doesn't that mean the site gets slower and slower to make?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951447041569370112)

Also, here's my github repo: https://t.co/lwrhango7J; [the rcode folder probably isn't that useful; mostly for scratch]  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951265206860214273)

> **Lucas Godoy** (@godoy_lusca; 2/1): @polesasunder I think #blogdown just rebuild the Rmd's you've changed. Maybe a better strategy would be first structure the site and then include the Rmd files. #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951453224330039296)

We used #liftr #Xaringan #blogdown #Rmarkdown #Rstudio as much as we could.

It is not perfect, we could have used more functions, less copy/paste and do it more reproductible. But it is what it is. 2/3 https://t.co/4m1jYt7a1p  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951570745942999041)

Here's an e-book which shows you everything you need to know to get started:

As a backup, i'll make a word doc, but the tables don't look nearly as nice...)  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951476595373629445)
