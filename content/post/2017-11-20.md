> **** (@; 3/0): @CivicAngela @GoldbergData @RLadiesGlobal You can read the Chapter 3 and Appendix C of the blogdown book: https://t.co/LHTWHYqp2l I also mentioned in the book that I don't recommend Github Pages, but you certainly can use it.

# bookdown

> **** (@; 4/1): If it helps anyone do the same: https://t.co/5vpaW3jYBU and https://t.co/qzeKzy15SH  that a) build a conference programme from a database stored in Google Sheets and b) generate the conference programme in bookdown. In hindsight, using SQLlite mk the DB would have been better.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/932080671534735360)

> **** (@; 0/0): @ShotbyRobins The solution was rather unexpected - using the bookdown epub as input for Calibre, and then using Calibre to output the different formats gave me almost exactly what I wanted, including a better ePub!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/932400027531558913)

> **** (@; 0/0): @jakekaupp Yeah, ultimately bookdown is just a wrapper for R Markdown, so I just used the base functionality of R Markdown to achieve my aim.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/932266463724953601)

> **** (@; 0/0): @dannyjnwong I feel the docx tunnel vision in academia pain. Bookdown is still rmarkdown and can render to docx to satisfy those that love Word.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/932264104827473921)

> **** (@; 0/0): @jakekaupp I did consider bookdown but decided against it. My supervisor and collaborators like working with docx  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/932252452052717570)

> **** (@; 0/0): @rmflight I tried it w/ knitr 1.17.15 &amp; reticulate 1.3 in @RStudio R notebook and Rmd; didn't work for me: #Python chunks do not display results inline. Variables do not show up in the environment pane or get shared across chunks. When I knit, the Python chunks disappear.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/932242687113224192)
