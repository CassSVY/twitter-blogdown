> **Taraas** (@imtaraas; 1/0): @xieyihui @dataandme @BecomingDataSci @kierisi You guys convinced me. Spending my Sunday resurrecting my blogdown site. Lots of work! Errors on errors! WTF! But we'll get through them all!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/950062294423220224)

> **Shamindra Shrotriya** (@shamindraas; 1/0): @xieyihui @ma_salmon @alspur @rweekly_live @NicholasStrayer @LucyStats Oh wow! Thanks for awesome DS_Store tip @xieyihui and for creating blogdown (and the encouragement)!  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949866007413362688)

> **Mike Treglia** (@MikeTreglia; 0/3): It's finally time to redo my webpage after ~10 years... Looks like #rstats #blogdown is a good way to go. Question re: blogdown/#hugo - if I start with a theme, and updates are made by the theme creator, what's the best way to pull those updates into my site?

> **Nicolas Roelandt** (@RoelandtN42; 0/1): Today I got 2 answers while looking into the #blogdown docs for 1 question.
1. Is that safe to gitignore public/ ? (Yes it is even recommended)
>
2. a custom YAML file for gitlab-ci (I swear it wasn't there last time I looked and it is far more better than the one I did)

> **Nicolas Roelandt** (@RoelandtN42; 0/0): I had big merge conflicts because we are 3 people working on the same website. So 3 different version of the site made by local blogdown::serve_site().
A merge nightmare, worst my colleages are not comfortable with git.

@xieyihui your doc saved my sorry a**. Again. Twice !  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/950136922227257344)

> **Eric Scott** (@LeafyEricScott; 0/0): Making a website with #blogdown has got me thinking‚Äîmarkdown/pandoc would be a great way to maintain a CV and create different, job-tailored short resum√©s from it.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/950054028888739840)

> **Charles T. Gray** (@cantabile; 0/0): @rensa_co Am trying to onboard my blogpost for @rOpenSci, but RStudio keeps making extra files. Maybe it's 'cause I ran blogdown::serve_site? Anyway, can't pull with extra files.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949924122691174402)

# bookdown

> **Steph Locke** (@SteffLocke; 29/3): Yeah, so umm you should probably get into the habit of naming your #rmarkdown chunks. This bookdown compilation of two days of training is pretty hard to debug with ~9k lines when unknown-chunk768 goes wrong. Let me be an object lesson to you all! https://t.co/wQBOk3U319  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/950084645730902017)

> **Charles Franklin** (@PollsAndVotes; 5/1): @gelliottmorris Xie‚Äôs book is very good. I‚Äôve been using knitr with LaTeX (and Sweave) for a long, long time. But Markdown is attractive for simplicity. I‚Äôm a little concerned about fine control but enough books in Markdown to reassure me.  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/949867160465113088)
