> **Mauro Lepore** (@mauro_lepore; 0/0): @umairdurrani87 @dataandme @rweekly_org @kierisi Thanks! 
To keep the https://t.co/8FooWjV1sW project simple here I did an ugly copy-paste. 
If you don't mind the complex structure of blogdown you could create your https://t.co/8FooWjV1sW project from your GitHub repo. https://t.co/I2dJOxGH3T  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973730421153386496)

> **Umair Durrani** (@umairdurrani87; 0/0): @mauro_lepore @dataandme @rweekly_org @kierisi Nice. What I liked most was that you provided a link to your #rstudio project on rcloud. Really awesome! Question: I'm sure you're using #blogdown but how did you manage using the Rmd both in Import Dataset project and your blogdown project simultaneously? #rstats  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973712058624696327)

# knitr

> **Sebastian Karcher** (@adam42smith; 1/0): This together with @benmarwick 's advice to use knitr::include_graphics is perfect; exactly what I was looking for. https://t.co/ECSn5XVYqd  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973584221087420416)

> **Ben Marwick** (@benmarwick; 1/0): @FrederikAust @adam42smith That's right, but instead of print,  I use knitr::include_graphics for greater control over the rendered image  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973582833233969152)

> **Josh Davis** (@jldavis; 0/0): @mrkhdly I know this because they asked me to write a book on knitr because I wrote a dinky little tutorial on it. I know another person that wrote a security book and he absolutely didnâ€™t have the credentials to be telling people about security. It was fangerous  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973609720018685954)
