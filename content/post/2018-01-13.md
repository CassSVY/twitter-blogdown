# blogdown

> **Taras Kaduk** (@taraskaduk; 2/0): @xieyihui convinced me to resurrect my blogdown site. After a few sleepless nights it is up and running again! https://t.co/wS6mCEs3pG 
(Not giving up on Medium though. Neither giving up on LinkedIn) https://t.co/SOEJRZb4HP  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951636413233225729)

> **Yihui Xie** (@xieyihui; 1/0): @polesasunder @pssGuy @davidjayharris @kwbroman I recommend you to spend a few more minutes on the official documentation; in particular, Section 1.7: https://t.co/iJ2uSnb1iQ I feel you can be quickly lost in the large amount of feedback on Twitter, which is often "conditionally" correct. In short, you rarely need build_site()  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951862535480897536)

# knitr

> **Pete Mohanty** (@petemohanty; 0/0): @daattali @_ColinFay @SteffLocke You prob saw this stack with similar for purl but just in case https://t.co/Cr2Bwk1mZh  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/951968810545790977)

> **Ranty C** (@orourke_the; 0/0): @zevross Before learning to use the pipe my R code was a maze of nested functions and/or confusingly named intermediate variables.  I feel pipes along with dplyr verbs have immensely cleaned up my code. Especially for reporting in knitr. Don’t understand the pipe haters.
