I hope I can overcome those and start enjoying its speed and #R-friendliness: https://t.co/BFvHEm2UNv . Any hints on how to solve those pesky URL rewriting and post rendering issues highly welcome!

# knitr

> **Jonathan E. Magen** (@yonkeltron; 0/0): @TeXtip I advise you consider knitr instead as it's a more modern alternative which is very much compatible with many Sweave tricks! https://t.co/fV6oqONnXO  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973210694253498368)

# xaringan

> **Carl Boettiger** (@cboettig; 0/0): @xieyihui Is there a way to tell xaringan to reveal code output only after code has been displayed (without simply duplicating code in a hidden chunk below a `--`)?  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/973357551415844864)
